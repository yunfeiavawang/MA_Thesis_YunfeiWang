各位前辈好，我是一名社科类研一硕士，近期有一些因参加年会/论坛而产生的疑惑，想向各位前辈寻求帮助/建议/看法/指点/批评。年底会议论坛密集，我也抱着试一试的想法参加了某省某二级学科的年会，并在投稿后收到了几次修改邮件。据同期参加同专业其他二级学科年会的同学反馈，收到修改意见说明论文有一定价值（基本上他们收到修改邮件的都获奖了）。可能因为同学中只有我被通知修改（原通知中的要求变更），让我误认为自己的文章是有价值的，所以对年会预期有些高。但最后我并没有获奖，反而是同学在截止前随便投的文段获奖了。祝贺之后一直处于很迷茫的状态。一是本科后期获得过很多论文写作的高分、老师同学的夸奖，本科毕业论文也一度被联系的硕导夸奖。这都曾让我以为自己在学术上是有能力、有天赋的。二是获奖的同学、前辈很多都很厉害，但确实有些不如我的但获奖了（结构不完整、域外内容的罗列占据文章大半等情况）。高期待、高评价与较低反馈之间让我有些怀疑自己的能力、认知以及未来的计划与安排。也有认真反思过，感觉没有获奖的原因可能如下：①论文和实务关系不够紧密，没有侧重于实践问题分析，而是偏向大环境下某一制度的改革趋势；②论文并非我提交的修改版，格式上有非常严重的问题，我自己在排版时绝对未出现这种情况；③没有和导师提前沟通投稿；④我在一声声夸奖中迷失了自我，其实我能力并不突出，而且欠缺一点点天赋和运气，目前所拥有的热爱不足以弥补这些支撑我读博。本科后半段其实就已经坚定了想要读博的想法，硕士伊始的一些选择也是围绕着读博进行的。但有很多事情发生在了意料之外，目前和专心学术的前辈的沟通机会较少，很多时候我对自己的评价都来自于同辈或由同辈所传递的他人看法（专心学术的老师和学长学姐）。在这半年的学习中，我也确实认识到了自己的输入不够，在能力上较大不足，也希望可以寻找一些提升自己能力的方法。第一次参加学术会议但却期待落空，对比之下有些失落和疑惑，想向大家请教如何调整落差、如何提升并正确认知自己能力和水平，谢谢大家！
